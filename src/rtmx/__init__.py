"""RTMX - Requirements Traceability Matrix toolkit for GenAI-driven development.

This package provides tools for managing requirements traceability in software projects,
with special focus on compliance frameworks (CMMC, FedRAMP) and GenAI integration.

Example:
    >>> from rtmx import RTMDatabase, Status
    >>> db = RTMDatabase.load("docs/rtm_database.csv")
    >>> incomplete = db.filter(status=Status.MISSING)
    >>> cycles = db.find_cycles()
